# ProcrastinationHub
Play games like Pong, Snake, and Dodger while you procrastinate on your homework!

Google Chrome extension that users can click on and play a few games while they procrastinate!
Games include:
- Pong vs a CPU
- Snake
- Dodger: My own creation ;)
All written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
I am currently learning web development and JavaScript and used this as practice! For Pong and Snake I followed these tutorials but adapted them to my own style:
